#Tyler Lubeck's Private Repo for Tufts Comp20, Spring 2013#

####======== Favorite Project ========####

My favorite project was Assignment 5, ScoreCenter.

####======== Proudest Project ========####

ScoreCenter is also the project I am most proud of. It taught me how to build my own web based API, which I feel will
be the most useful going forward. 

####======== Personal Growth ========####

I've learned a significant amount about how the web works. I've definitely learned about several new technologies, 
and now feel comfortable exploring the field on my own.
